Northstowe News is a magazine which is printed every two months, and distributed free to every home in the growing town of Northstowe in Cambridgeshire. It has always been produced for Northstowe residents and by Northstowe residents. In each issue you will find details of local community groups and churches, news from the local schools and the councils, details of upcoming sporting and social events and more.

Northstowe News is produced by a small group of volunteers. We're always looking for regular or one-off articles, photos, artwork, event reports, notices, and anything else that may be of interest to the Northstowe Community. If you would like to write in the magazine please email northstowenews@gmail.com with your questions, ideas and contributions.
